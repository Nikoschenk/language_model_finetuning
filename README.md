# language_model_finetuning
Scripts for fine-tuning pretrained language models on custom data sets, e.g. for fine-tuning [Sci-Bert](https://github.com/allenai/scibert) on the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) using the [Hugging Face Transformer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.

Examples are provided for using the models (SciBERT, SciBERT fine-tuned, and BERT-"original") for extractive summarization.
